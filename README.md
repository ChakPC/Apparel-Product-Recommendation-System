# Apparel-Product-Recommendation-System

This project recommends similar products on the basis of product that is seen.
This project is a prototype of content based Amazon recommendation system for Women Apparels. It involves Natural Language
Processing using the nltk library in python. In NLTK, brown corpus is used here. Results for 2 of the NLP models ,i.e., Bag of Words and 
Tf-idf model are computed and the latter gives a better result. This recommendations is based on the titles of products only and then also
it gives quite good recommendations.
The raw data for this project is taken from Amazon product advertising API. The huge data is cleaned first and few features of the data 
have been used.
It has widespread applications in the e-commerce industry where similar products are shown to the customers for better experience.
